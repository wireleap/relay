# 0.6.0

- Depends on `wireleap/common` v0.3.3.
- Network usage limiting feature added.
- Added `network_usage` config section and per-contract
  `network_usage_limit` field.
- Relay will now disenroll from a contract when the network usage for
  that contract exceeds the defined value or disenroll from all
  contracts when the global value is reached.

- Uses interfaces:

  - `clientrelay` v0.2.0
  - `relaycontract` v0.1.0
  - `relayrelay` v0.2.0
  - `relaydir` v0.2.0
